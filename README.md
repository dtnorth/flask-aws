## üöÄ Flask Application Deployment on AWS with Terraform, Docker, and GitHub Actions  

This project automates the deployment of a **Flask application** to **AWS ECS (Fargate)** using **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning, **Docker** for containerization, and **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.

## **Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)** üèóÔ∏è  
The infrastructure is provisioned using **Terraform**, which includes:  
- **S3 Backend for State Storage** ‚Äì Ensures infrastructure state is securely stored with version control.  
- **VPC Configuration** ‚Äì Creates public and private subnets with a NAT gateway for secure networking.  
- **ECS Cluster & Task Definition** ‚Äì Defines the application deployment environment using AWS Fargate.  
- **CloudWatch Logs** ‚Äì Enables logging and monitoring of the application.  
- **Security Groups** ‚Äì Controls access to the application by defining network rules.  

This setup allows for a scalable, resilient, and secure deployment of the Flask application.  

---

## **Containerization (Docker)** üê≥  
The Flask application is containerized using **Docker**, following a multi-stage build process for efficiency.  

### **Key Features of the Dockerfile:**  
- **Uses a Slim Python Base Image** ‚Äì Reduces the final image size.  
- **Multi-Stage Build** ‚Äì Ensures dependencies are installed efficiently.  
- **Runs as a Non-Root User** ‚Äì Improves security.  
- **Exposes Port 5000** ‚Äì Configured for Flask and Gunicorn.  
- **Gunicorn for Production** ‚Äì Enhances performance and reliability.  

### **Local Development and Testing:**  
1. **Build the Docker Image**  
   ```sh
   docker build --no-cache -t flask-app:1.0.0 .
   ```  
2. **Run the Container Locally**  
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-container flask-app:1.0.0
   ```  
3. **Access the Application on `localhost:5000`**  

---

## **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)** ‚öôÔ∏è  
The **GitHub Actions** workflow automates the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration and delivery.  

### **Pipeline Workflow:**  
1. **Triggers on Code Push** ‚Äì Any branch push initiates the pipeline.  
2. **Builds the Docker Image** ‚Äì Ensures a fresh and updated image is created.  
3. **Scans for Security Vulnerabilities** ‚Äì Uses **Trivy** to identify potential threats failing the pipeline on defined threats. 
4. **Pushes the Image to AWS ECR** ‚Äì Ensures centralized and secure image storage.  
5. **Deploys to AWS ECS** ‚Äì Updates the running application on AWS Fargate.  

This automated workflow ensures **secure, fast, and reliable** application deployments.

### **3. Push Code to GitHub**  
Trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing changes to GitHub.  

### **4. Monitor Deployment**  
- **GitHub Actions:** Check logs to monitor the pipeline execution.  
- **AWS ECS Console:** Verify that the application is deployed and running.  

---

## **Future Enhancements** üî•  
- **Automate Terraform Deployment**   ‚Äì Integrate Terraform within GitHub Actions.  
- **Implement Blue-Green Deployment** ‚Äì Reduce downtime during application updates.  
- **Add Performance Monitoring**      ‚Äì Leverage AWS CloudWatch for real-time observability.

To create the resources in AWS, run:

## terraform apply

---
## Push Docker Image to ECR
```
After the initial infrastructure is set up, build and push your Docker image to ECR:
or allow the github action to perform the operation.
```sh 
## docker build --no-cache -t flask-app:1.0.0 .
## docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name flask-container flask-app:1.0.0
```
```sh
##$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1)
## docker tag flask-app:latest <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flask-app-repository:latest
## docker push <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/flask-app-repository:latest##
```
---
### Verify ECS Deployment:

Go to the AWS ECS console and ensure that the service is running with the Flask app.

### Clean Up

To delete all the resources created by Terraform, run:

### terraform destroy

This will remove the VPC, ECS cluster, task definition, service, and other resources.

### Further Considerations

### Infracost 

Build infracost into the terraform deploy CI/CD pipeline to allow costing of any terraform changes
before deployment.   

This tool utilises the AWS Cost API to build its analysis on any scanned terraform code.

### Trivy

Consider adding a **TRIVY** step in the docker CI/CD pipeline to highlight CVE Vulnerabilities before image push to ECR.

### Utilise a self-hosted github actions runner 

Consider a self hosted actions runner to mitigate potential github runner run limits and costs
